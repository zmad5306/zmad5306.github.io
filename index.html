      <section>
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div class="card full-width">
          <p>
            I’m a seasoned <strong>Software Engineer and Architect</strong> with nearly two decades
            of experience building and modernizing systems across government and private-sector
            organizations. My work spans <strong>mainframe to cloud</strong> – from COBOL/CICS and
            DB2 to microservices, containerization, and data platforms on <strong>Azure</strong> and
            <strong>AWS</strong>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I specialize in designing and delivering
            <strong>secure, scalable, and maintainable systems</strong>: cloud-native APIs, data
            pipelines, and microservices with clear boundaries and strong security. I’m equally
            comfortable in <strong>Java (Spring Boot)</strong> and <strong>.NET / C#</strong>, with
            deep experience in <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>, <strong>SQL Server</strong>, and
            enterprise integration patterns.
          </p>
          <p>
            I treat AI as a <strong>force multiplier</strong>, not a replacement for engineers. I
            use AI as a capable junior developer — fast and tireless — while I focus on
            <strong>architecture, intent, and correctness</strong>. Typing code isn’t the job;
            engineering reliable systems is.

            of the platform to <strong>AWS ECS</strong> with full containerization and one-click
            CI/CD, and designed <strong>PostgreSQL-backed reporting APIs</strong> with significant
            performance tuning.
