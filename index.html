<!-- ABOUT -->
<section>
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <div class="card full-width">
    <p>
      I’m a seasoned <strong>Software Engineer and Architect</strong> with nearly two decades of
      experience building and modernizing systems across government and private-sector
      organizations. My work spans <strong>mainframe to cloud</strong> – from COBOL/CICS and DB2 to
      microservices, containerization, and data platforms on <strong>Azure</strong> and
      <strong>AWS</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I specialize in designing and delivering
      <strong>secure, scalable, and maintainable systems</strong>: cloud-native APIs, data
      pipelines, and microservices with clear boundaries and strong security. I’m equally
      comfortable in <strong>Java (Spring Boot)</strong>, <strong>.NET / C#</strong>, and
      <strong>modern JavaScript/TypeScript</strong> — including
      <strong>Node.js, Angular, and React</strong> — with deep experience in
      <strong>PostgreSQL</strong>, <strong>SQL Server</strong>, and enterprise integration patterns.
    </p>
    <p>
      I treat AI as a <strong>force multiplier</strong>, not a replacement for engineers. I use AI
      as a capable junior developer — fast and tireless — while I focus on
      <strong>architecture, intent, and correctness</strong>. Typing code isn’t the job; engineering
      reliable systems is.

<!-- HOW I CAN HELP -->
<section>
  <h2>How I Can Help</h2>
  <div class="card full-width">
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Cloud modernization:</strong> migrate legacy workloads to Azure or AWS with
        Infrastructure-as-Code, automation, and observability built in.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Secure microservices:</strong> design clear service boundaries, auth flows, and
        gateway policies for distributed systems that are easy to reason about and operate.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Data & integration:</strong> build reliable ETL/ELT pipelines, APIs, and
        event-driven integrations using ADF, SSIS, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Architecture & mentoring:</strong> help teams adopt better patterns, tame
        complexity, and ship systems that are maintainable long after the first release.

  <h2>AI-Augmented Engineering</h2>
  <div class="card full-width">
    <p>
      I use AI as a <strong>capable junior developer</strong> — fast, literal, and tireless — while
      I stay accountable for architecture, security, and correctness. My focus is on
      <strong>using AI to accelerate delivery</strong>, not to replace engineering judgment.

    <h3>Score Card — Observability-Driven Distributed Transaction Engine</h3>
    <p class="subdued">
      Java 17 • Spring Boot • JMS / ActiveMQ • REST API • OpenAPI • PostgreSQL • Docker
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Score Card</strong> is a research project and working prototype that explores a new
      way to manage <strong>complex, cross-service transactions</strong> without relying on
      heavyweight orchestration, 2PC, or tightly coupled saga coordinators. Instead of forcing
      microservices to participate in a global transaction, Score Card uses
      <strong>observability, correlation, and dependency-aware authorization</strong> to reconstruct
      and reason about multi-step workflows as they unfold.
    </p>
    <p>
      At its core, Score Card models a transaction as a graph of actions across independent
      services. Each service performs its work autonomously and reports status updates back to the
      Score Card engine, which assembles a real-time view of the end-to-end flow. This enables
      <strong>failure detection, auditing, recovery, and compensation</strong> without sacrificing
      service autonomy or scalability.

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Explicit workflow modeling:</strong> services, actions, dependencies, and
        transaction blueprints definable via REST or UI.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Loose coupling:</strong> microservices stay independent; Score Card coordinates
        using messages and correlation IDs.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Real-time observability:</strong> action states, timestamps, metadata, and outcomes
        tracked in PostgreSQL.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Resilience & recovery:</strong> compensating transactions (e.g., reversing a
        financial debit) triggered from observed failures.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Developer UIs included:</strong> a model portal and a live scoreboard for monitoring
        transaction execution.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Example microservices:</strong> including a banking transfer scenario demonstrating
        sequencing, retries, and compensation.
      </li>

    <p>
      I operate a personal <strong>Linux server</strong> hosting a suite of
      <strong>containerized services</strong>, including Nextcloud, Pi-hole, WireGuard VPN, and
      monitoring tools. This homelab serves as a sandbox for experimenting with container
      orchestration, networking, automation, and secure self-hosting — and keeps my personal
      infrastructure fully under my control.
